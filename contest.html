	  <p>Updated <b>April 4, 2018</b>

	  <p>In PA1, you will compete to build a congestion-control
	    algorithm to maximize "power" (throughput / delay) on an
	    emulated cellular network. You will start with
	    a <a href="https://github.com/keithw/sourdough/tree/master/datagrump">simple UDP
	    sender and receiver</a>, built on C++ networking
	    classes that do most of the grunt work of opening
	    sockets and reading and writing datagrams.

	  <p>By modifying the behavior of the congestion controller
	    (implemented in <a href="https://github.com/keithw/sourdough/blob/master/datagrump/controller.cc">controller.cc</a>), you can control how
	    the sender decides when to send datagrams. The more
	    datagrams it sends, the more your throughput will be,
	    at the risk of building up an in-network standing queue
	    and resulting delay.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Watch video</h2>
	  
	  <p>Please watch this 25-minute video on the Sprout
	    algorithm:<br>

	    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FUgdF-2V8Cw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

	  </p>
	  
<h2>Step 2: Install the contest software</h2>

	  <p>Please set up the contest software on a GNU/Linux machine (physical or virtual) of your choosing. If you
use GNU/Linux on your computer, the below steps are probably best run directly. Otherwise, we have prepared a
<a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs244/vm/cs244-vm-15.10.ova">VirtualBox image</a> that you can use to install the contest software. Please note that because your
software runs in real time, the best performance will be achieved on a faster (and preferably non-virtual) machine.
You may find that an EC2 instance gives more reliable results than your own laptop, but without the animated
graphs that can give help for debugging and development.</p>

<p>Please post any difficulties on <a href="https://piazza.com/stanford/spring2018/cs244">the Piazza forum</a>. The following steps worked successfully on Ubuntu GNU/Linux 14.04 through 17.10:</p>
	  <div class="well">

	    $ <code>git clone <a href="https://github.com/ravinet/mahimahi">https://github.com/ravinet/mahimahi</a></code> <span class="text-muted">(the mahimahi tools provide our emulated cellular network and measurement tools)</span><br>

	    $ <code>sudo make install</code><br>
	    $ <code>cd ..</code><br>
	    $ <code>git clone <a href="https://github.com/keithw/sourdough">https://github.com/keithw/sourdough</a></code><br>
	    $ <code>cd sourdough</code><br>
	    $ <code>./autogen.sh && ./configure && make</code> <span class="text-muted">(compile the contest code the usual way)</span><br>
	    $ <code>sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1</code><span class="text-muted">(have to enable Linux's IP forwarding for mahimahi to work)</span><br>
	    $ <code>cd datagrump</code><br>
	  </div>

	  <h2>Step 3: run the example code</h2>
	  <div class="well">

<p> This command will run the congestion-controller
	    in <a href="https://github.com/keithw/sourdough/blob/master/datagrump/controller.cc">https://github.com/keithw/sourdough/blob/master/datagrump/controller.cc</a>
	    for about two minutes over an emulated Verizon LTE (4G)
	    connection. While it runs, you will see an animation of
	    the network's capacity, the sending rate of the algorithm,
	    and the in-network queueing delay. After the run
	    completes, it will upload your results to the contest
  website. If you do not see "upload successful," please
report the problem on Piazza.</p>

<p><b>Please use the same scheme name for each of your submissions &mdash; otherwise you will pollute the leaderboard.</b></p>
	    
	    $ <code>./run-contest <i>[scheme_name]</i></code><br>

</pre>
	  </div>
	  
	  <h2>Step 4: visit your analysis URL</h2>

	  <p>The URL given by the uploader will allow you to see
	    the results of your congestion-control scheme, compared with others in the class,
	    the winning entries from previous classes, and the Sprout algorithm. (You will need to visit the URL for your algorithm to join the leaderboard.)</p>
	  
	  <h2>Step 5: the homework assignment</h2>

	  <p>First, read through the existing congestion controller in
	    the <a href="https://github.com/keithw/sourdough/tree/master/datagrump">datagrump</a>
	    directory. To modify the congestion-control behavior, you
	    will <strong>probably</strong> will only need to modify
	    the <code>controller.cc</code> file, and
	    perhaps <code>controller.hh</code>. If necessary, though,
	    you are free to modify anything in sourdough (except the
	  <code>run-contest</code> script).</p>

	  <p>Please write up your answers to the below exercises in a
	  report, to be submitted in PDF form:</p>

	  <ul><li>Warmup exercise A [10%]: Vary the fixed window size by
	  editing <code>controller.cc</code> to see what happens. Make
	  a 2D graph of throughput vs. 95-percentile signal delay
	  (similar to what is seen on the contest analysis URLs)
	  as you vary this value. What is the best single window size
          that you can find to maximize the overall "score" (log
          throughput/delay)? How repeatable are the measurements taken
          with the same window size over multiple runs?</li>

	    <li>Warmup exercise B [20%]: Implement a
          simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_increase/multiplicative_decrease">AIMD
          scheme</a>, similar to TCP's congestion-avoidance phase. How
          well does this work? What constants, and what backoff trigger, did you choose?</li>

<!--
	    <li>Warmup exercise C [20%]: Implement a simple delay-triggered scheme, where the
          window rises or falls based on whether the round-trip-time
          crosses some threshold value. Experiment with a few
          thresholds or tweaks and report on what worked the best.</li>
-->

	    <li>Exercise C [65%]: <b>the contest</b>. Try different
	      approaches and work to maximize your score on the final
	      evaluation. Be wary about "overtraining": after the
	      contest is over, we will collect new network traces and
	      then run everybody's entries over the newly-collected
	      evaluation trace. In your report, please explain your
	      approach, including the important decisions you had to make and how you made them. Include illustrative plots.</li>

	    <li>Exercise D [5%]: pick a cool name for your scheme!</li>

	  </ul>

	  <h2>Step 6: submission</h2>

	  <p>The homework is due at <strong>5:00 p.m. Pacific time on
	      Tuesday, April 17</strong>. Please submit your report as PDF and a
	    link to a Git repository where we can download your
	    code. Please run the submit script on your PDF file: <code>/afs/ir/class/cs244/bin/submit 1 <i>reportname</i>.pdf</code>.

	    <p><b>Provisos</b>: Your Git repository must inherit from the current
	    commit on the <code>datagrump</code> repository. Please do
<b>not</b> simply copy the files into a new Git repository&mdash;we would
like you to make a series of small commits that inherit from the current
master branch. (If you need assistant with Git, the course staff
is happy to help!)
Your
	    code should work without modifying
	      the <code>run-contest</code> script. Please include the
	      summary statistics (score, delay, throughput) you
	      achieved on the Verizon 140-second trace, so we can make
	      sure your code is running as expected.</p>

	  <p><b>Good luck!</b> The top submissions will be given an
opportunity to describe their approach in class.</p>
